# Competition simulation model
This is a part of join university project from 2022.
authors: Mateusz Pieszczek, Michał Tomanek, Karolina Sikora, Michał Zieliński

Aim of the project was to run some simulations of Lotki-Volter species competition models.
We compared deterministic and stochastic models.


In this repository there is code from, my part of the project:
- stochastic model simulation
- generating animated visualizations of model

Saving might take some time depending on what quality we will set.
For reference, you can check `renders_example`.
